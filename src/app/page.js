                                In order to protect both you and myself, you will need to sign a contract before I can begin any work (including domain/hosting management). Most of the contract is boring legal jargon that only exists to make things clearer to the courts should a claim be made. However, if you are unhappy with any particular clause, you'll have the opportunity to negotiate this with me. You can read more about the contracts we use <Link href="/contracts">here</Link>.

                            <AccordionItemPanel>
                                Yes. Unfortunately, both the server company and domain registrar require a monthly or annual fee from me to keep your website online. The exact pricing of these depends on both your expected traffic and the domain name you choose (this is, unfortunately, out of my control). I'll make it clear the exact pricing of these before you commit to anything. This will also include a small service fee for my time, to keep everything under one easy-to-understand price.

                            <AccordionItemPanel>
                                Hosting is charged monthly, while domain management is charged annually. This is due to the nature of how hosting companies and domain registrars charge customers. You will need to pay the cost of the billing cycle upfront, and I will then manage the domain/hosting for you for the duration of the billing cycle.
