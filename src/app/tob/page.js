                <h1>Terms of Business</h1>
                <p>Effective date: 8th day of July, 2023</p>
                <p>These terms of business ("Terms", "Agreement") are an agreement between Jack's Software House ("Jack's Software House", "us", "we" or "our") and you ("User", "you" or "your"). This Agreement sets forth the general terms and conditions of any exchange of goods or services between us and you.</p>
                <p>If you are happy with our quotation and wish to go ahead, initially we ask that you contact us via email to confirm.</p>
                <p>Once you confirm our quotation given we can begin work subject to these terms of business. In cases where no proposal or contract was signed, quotation was provided or needed, any instructions, guidance or requests to engage our services will also mean we can begin work subject to these terms of business.</p>

                <h2>1. Charges</h2>
                <p>Our Fees are defined in the quotation that you have accepted. Quotes are valid for a period of 30 days and after that time, we reserve the right to decline or alter a quotation. You may be required to make an initial payment and this will be documented in your quotation. If that is the case, we will not begin work until this initial payment is received. We're sure you understand how important it is as a small business that you pay the invoices that we send you promptly. Invoices are normally sent via email however you can request hard copy invoices. Unless otherwise stated, payment of our invoice is due upon receipt. Any accounts that remain unpaid 14 days after the date of the invoice will have interest on the overdue amount at the rate of 25% per year. This interest shall accrue on a daily basis from the due date until the date of actual payment whether before or after Judgment. We also reserve the right to invoke the Late Payment of Commercial Debts Act which may subject you to further interest and/or penalty payments. We are happy to migrate your existing website and will do so for a standard agreed fee. However if this matter becomes unduly complicated and the time taken to do this work exceeds more than one hour, you will be charged at our usual hourly rate of £15.</p>
                <p>You are also responsible for any additional expenses necessary for the completion of any work over and above that included in your quotation. Examples would be purchase of special fonts and stock photography as these take time to source and select. You will be advised of any additional charges as they are incurred.</p>

                <h2>2. When We Will Provide the Service</h2>
                <p>We will begin working on your account as soon as we have all signed documentation back from you and any initial payment has been made. The estimated time for completion is on your quotation. Time shall not be of the essence unless we are previously advised of this and accept the deadlines that you provide us.</p>

                <h2>3. Client Review</h2>
                <p>We will give you an opportunity to review the design and content of the website or any other work we undertake on your behalf during and after the initial design phase and again once the overall development is completed. Once the work has been completed in accordance with the quotation given to you we shall consider it automatically approved and our work concluded unless you notify us otherwise within 5 working days of the date the final materials are sent to you.</p>

                <h2>4. Monopoly Policy</h2>
                <p>If a website is found to be monopolising the resources available to use, we reserve the right to suspend that site immediately. This Policy is only implemented in extreme circumstances and is intended to prevent the misuse of our servers. You may be offered an option whereby we continue to provide the serves but only for an additional fee. This Policy will only be implemented where a particular website receives very excessive traffic or an attack. Actions will then be taken to limit the damage that this excessive traffic impact has on other websites and services we provide for other customers.</p>

                <h2>5. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
                <p>You will retain copyright to all data, files and graphic logos provided by you and grant us all necessary rights to publish and use such material. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have all necessary permissions to use any information that you pass to us particularly any such information that may be owned by a third party and you warrant that any data, files, logos or other information that you provide to us shall not infringe the rights including any intellectual property rights of any third party.</p>
                <p>You are to indemnify us in respect of all liabilities, costs, expenses, damages and losses (including any direct, indirect or consequential  losses, loss of profit, loss of reputation and all interest, penalties and legal costs and all other reasonable costs and expenses suffered or incurred arising out of or in connection with any claim brought against us for actual or alleged infringement of a third party’s intellectual property rights arising out of or in connection with the receipt, use or supply of information, data, files and logos from you. Once your website is launched you will own all elements of text, images and data you provided unless someone else owns them. We'll give you source files and finished files and you should keep them somewhere safe as we are not required to keep a copy. Copyright will remain with any assets on licence from its copyright owners. We will own all other assets such as text, images, and videos that we created and also the unique combination of these elements that constitutes a complete design including site files and database.</p>
                <p>You agree that you will not copy, reproduce, alter, modify or create derivative works from the website created by us and will not permit any robots, spider, other automated device or manual process to monitor or copy any content from the website created by us.</p>
                <p>Once the website is launched we will provide you with a licence for the whole combination of these elements that constitutes a complete design exclusively and in perpetuity for this project only. Should you require use of any of the elements mentioned above for any other purpose, you are to contact us in order for a licence to be granted for that particular use.</p>
                <p>We love to show off our work and share what we have learned with other people so we reserve the right to use any and all assets provided by you. We may showcase our work and may link to your project as part of our portfolio and write about it on websites in magazine articles or books. A link to our website will appear in either small type or by small graphic at the bottom of your website. If a graphic is used it will be designed to fit in with the overall site design. We can remove the design credit for a nominal fee of 10% of the total development charges with a minimum fee of £200.00.</p>

                <h2>6. Data Protection</h2>
                <p>Both parties will comply with all applicable requirements of the Data Protection Legislation. We have our own Data Protection Policy which can be found <a href="/privacy" className="text-blue hover:underline hover:opacity-75">here</a>.</p>

                <h2>7. Failure to Provide Information</h2>
                <p>We will need certain information from you so we can supply our service to you. This will have been advised to you previously. If you do not give us the information within 2 weeks of us asking for it or if you give us incomplete or incorrect information, we may either end the contract or temporarily close the project which will involve an additional administration charge of £100 in respect of the time it will take us to reschedule yours and others work, or make an additional charge of a reasonable sum to compensate us for any extra work that is required as a result. We will not be responsible for supplying our services late or not supplying any part of them if this is caused by you not giving us the information we need within a reasonable time of us asking for it.</p>
